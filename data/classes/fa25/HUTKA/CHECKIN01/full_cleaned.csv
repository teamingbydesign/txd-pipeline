Our meetings are extremely unproductive. And it's not that we aren't working hard, but we are just working hard in conflicting ideas and goals, so we end up getting nowhere. And it's not like we don't talk about our ideas and goals, in fact, we spend too much time talking about it that it takes up almost the entirety of every meeting, rather than actually working on the assignment. When I bring these issues up, somehow my concerns are ultimately dismissed even if most the group says they agree with it. Then, when completing even the simplest task, it seems like we always decide that to avoid doing double work, we will do triple work in advance. But then the triple work isn't done on time and we end up doing quadruple work later. Our work habits don't mesh well together. I think we should come to meetings more prepared and have more clear, shared goals. Otherwise, I feel like we all might be much more productive independently than in a group together. 

Honestly, I really want to just work alone on this project now, even though I like all the teammates on a personal level, I think we don't really align in how we work or what our goals are. I like working in groups too! But none of my typical strategies at getting a group to work together well is working out.

We've had a few instances where we didn't finish tasks by our own team's deadlines due to misalignment. I feel this slows us down and leads to a situation where a few people will have to correct errors closer to the deadline, which disproportionately redistributes work.
