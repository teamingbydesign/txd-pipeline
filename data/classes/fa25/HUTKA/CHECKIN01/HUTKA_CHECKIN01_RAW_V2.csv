By that I mean, setting timelines on when who should do what and for what assignment.","Two things rather. First, we need to improve on communication to make sure there's clear alignment on what each member is expected to do. That includes reviewing instructions and rubrics together then brainstorming at a high level the expected results before dividing and conquering. We've had a few instances where we didn't finish tasks by our own team's deadlines due to misalignment. I feel this slows us down and leads to a situation where a few people will have to correct errors closer to the deadline, which disproportionately redistributes work.

Second, I think our team risks developing a ""let's just get it done"" mindset whenever we don't review the rubric closely. That's something we could think about even though I understand the work/deadlines in this class can somewhat feel overwhelming and so demanding.","Resourceful to the team, which is great!
