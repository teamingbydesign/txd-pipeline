Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do right now other than manufacturing.",,Something we all should have done differently is complete more jacob's and machine shop trainings earlier on in the semester. I think we could have also done a better job at trust our unexperienced members with more manufacturing responsibilities. ,,1,7,4,6,2,4,4,2,7,4,6,2,4,4,1,4,4,2,2,4,4,7,2,4,4,1,2,1,Andrew has been extremely clutch in the manufacturing effort of our part.

He is having a hard time outside of school right now which is preventing him from committing to contributions, but I give him credit for trying to contribute as much as possible during meeting times.",No longer with us :( I hope your other class projects are going well. It was good working with you.,,For my own contributions I will be qualitative. During Spring break I spent 6+ hours trouble shooting the printer with Jay at my house. During Cal day Jay and I again worked on the printer for 5 hours at my house. I edited and submitted a video for our printer progress report. I spent 2 hours studying how to the water jet works and setting up the cut path for our job on OMAX Layout so that Andrew could just upload that file and run the machine. I created 3 of the 5 GD&T Drawings. I've been handling meeting logistics and helped film for our video. I went to Ace to pick up last minute bolts for the project.  ,Minseo comes in with a good attitude and is willing to help where ever she can.,Yuyang comes in with a good attitude and is willing to help where ever he can. ,"I think Andrew could have done a better job respecting other group members and allowing them to contribute where possible. He has done most of the manufacturing because he is the only one of us with the proper access. However, for non-manufacturing related tasks he also insists that he does most of that work as well simply because he wants to. Although this is appreciated, it leaves very little work for those of us who do not have manufacturing access to do. He also often critiques work done by other group members to an extent that I personally find unnecessary. I think he has a higher standard of quality for this project than all of the other group members that makes collaboration with him difficult.",Liam should have taken a more active effort to contribute to the project outside of group meeting times. Although he did his best to contribute during meeting times he as often unaware of where we were in the project which made assigning him work difficult. ,No longer with us :(,Ansh had a lot of manufacturing and other related engineering experience that I think would have been really useful if he committed more time to our project. He often does not produce work by the time he said he would which makes it difficult to rely on him.,"I've stated this else where, but I really regret not getting more manufacturing trainings earlier on in the semester. I feel like I've been a highly effective team member up until this point. Even though I have done my best to take on work outside of manufacturing (Preparing Water Jet Files, Working on the printer, GD&T Drawings, etc.) I feel like I am constantly grasping for something to do. I don't like that feeling. ",I think Minseo lacked confidence in her engineering abilities/ideas. I think the team could have done a better job at making her voice heard more often. I would have like to see Minseo be more assertive about what she wanted to do / contribute to.,Yuyang did a really great job the whole project to remain involved. He showed up to all of the meeting times and met contribution deadlines. My one point of feedback is that I wish Yuyang was more assertive during team debates. He was often impartial anytime we were having team disagreements withdrawing from conversation at those points. Because he been keeping up with team progress I valued his opinions and felt he could have shared his thoughts more often.,"It sounds like you're recognizing your team's effort to contribute positively, even if the current focus is primarily on manufacturing.
