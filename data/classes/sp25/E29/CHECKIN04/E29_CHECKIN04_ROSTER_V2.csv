Once we've gone around, people can choose a role that they like, based on their experience.","That sounds like a solid plan for meeting times and role management! Could you describe a bit more about how you will ensure that everyone is prepared for their roles each week? Also, how will you handle situations where someone cannot attend a meeting?","We will make sure everyone is prepared by defining the roles in the meeting prior, so they have at least a week to prepare. If someone cannot attend a meeting, we will try to see if we can meet a time that works better for the person, but if not, we will have them text what they've done that week and what they will do the next week, and to make sure to read the notes after the meeting.","We will make sure to always leverage people's skills when a part of the project requires it, but also pair them with someone who has less experience and wants to develop new skills. The experienced member will work closely with the team member with less experience so that they can share their knowledge and skill. Each member will have 2 projects, one that fits their experience, and one that requires them to learn a new skill. We will make sure that the teams' work gets completed on time and with high quality by setting weekly goals for people to meet, and if people have really large workloads, their partner can pick up their slack.","I appreciate your response! Can you describe a bit more about how you plan to set those weekly goals? What strategies will you use to make sure that everyone stays on track with their tasks? Also, how will you handle any conflicts or differences in workload between team members?","See what stage we have to do for a project and then split up the project into 6 different parts and create timelines for each week that can be completed in the allotted weeks. Our strategy to make sure everyone stays on track is at the meeting, people will show what they've done and we can comment on it. We can also have that week's time leader check in on them in the middle of the week as well. We'll handle conflicts and differences in workload by talking about it in the meeting and be understanding.","We will create and maintain a sense of psychological safety by allowing time for each person to say their thoughts in the beginning and end of the meeting, uninterrupted, and then others can comment after they're done. If they have nothing to say, they can say simply pass","That sounds like a solid start to fostering psychological safety! Could you describe a bit more about how you plan to handle situations where someone might feel hesitant to share? Additionally, how will you encourage active listening during those discussions?","If they're hesitant to share, they can share it with one person first so they can tell them what they think, which will help the person gain more confidence so they can tell the group.",I help teammates who are falling behind,I teach my teammates how to do elements of the work,I ask my teammates for feedback on how I can improve,,1

I have some experience with product/engineering design but most of it has been by myself so I want to gain experience in a team setting.,Jack,"My goal in this class is to learn each manufacturing process and apply them to several different types of parts. also, I want to learn how to collectively plan for projects and make them some to life for other peoples benefit.",,,One of our team objectives is to create a unique device that solves a specific problem; we also hope to earn an A on our final project grade.,"That sounds like a solid start! Could you describe a bit more about the specific problem you want to solve with your device? Also, how will you ensure that you meet the quality standards needed to achieve that A grade?","The specific problem that we want to solve is that in toilet stalls, the locks and hooks are frequently broken or in the case of the hook, nonexistent. So we want to design something that solves both of those problems, that can keep the door from opening and can allow you to hang a coat or bag.

Our idea to meet the quality standards needed to achieve our grade goal is to plan ahead, communicate effectively, and set clear objectives/expectations for everyone","We have a group chat for general communication. We will use Google Drive to capture team documents and share ideas. Additionally, we will meet in person during our lab time to check in on progress and assess the team's next steps.","It sounds like you have a solid foundation for your communication plan! Could you describe a bit more about how often you plan to use the group chat and how quickly you expect team members to respond? Also, how will you make sure everyone contributes during your in-person meetings?","We will use the group chat on a need-to-need basis, simply whenever something needs to be communicated with no set frequency. To ensure we don't go too long without communication, we will have our in-person meetings during lab sessions. During these meetings, we will have everyone briefly present what progress they've made and their plan for next steps.","We will use team consensus for decisions. We will make preliminary decisions when members are not present and then inform them of the decision in the group chat and wait for their feedback before officiating the decision. Finally, we will document our decision in a google doc.","That's a solid start! Can you think about how you'll handle disagreements if there are differing opinions during the consensus-building process? Also, could you describe a bit more about what your group chat will look like, and how you'll ensure everyone feels heard before finalizing those decisions?","We will handle opinions by having everyone express their opinions and explain their reasoning until we reach a consensus on the best option. In specific situations, we'll use a majority vote system. Our group chat will be a casual place to communicate and ask questions, anything we could need for general communication. We will ensure everyone feels heard before finalizing decisions by getting full consensus and enthusiasm about the decisions from all members.",We'll have flexible roles so that no one person is forced into a specific role. We will all do a bit of everything. We have decided to meet every week during lab session.,"I think it's great that you plan to keep roles flexible, but could you describe a bit more about how you will ensure that everyone has a chance to contribute in different roles? Also, meeting during lab session sounds convenient—are there specific days or times that work best for everyone?","Our hope is that each student has the opportunity to take on a leadership role in their area of expertise; if they are particularly skilled in writing, machining, or CAD for example, they can guide the rest of the group during those aspects of the project. We will meet every Friday sometime between our 2-5pm lab section.","Through specialized trainings offered through the Mechanical Engineering machine shop and the Jacobs Maker Space, group members can learn how to use specialized tools and equipment a la carte. More experienced members can also guide other students and walk them through processes related to various aspects of our project. Before jumping into the project, we can discuss our skills and abilities and determine what each of us can specialized on based on the project overview document. ","That’s a great start! Could you describe a bit more about how you will ensure that everyone in the team feels supported in developing new skills? Also, what specific strategies will you use to keep the project on track and maintain high quality in your work?","More experienced members should approach new members with patience, kindness, and a willingness to help. By supporting each other, we can ensure that each person can learn more about engineering and machining without judgment.","We will have a five-minute check-in at the end of each meeting to ensure that we are all on the same page. Also, when sharing ideas during a brainstorming session, we can preface the meeting by saying that all ideas are open to discussion without criticism or judgment.","I appreciate your response! Could you describe a bit more about how you plan to facilitate the brainstorming sessions to ensure everyone truly feels comfortable sharing their ideas? Additionally, how will you encourage active listening among team members during these discussions?",We can start by writing down ideas independently and then regrouping to share what we came up with. We will discuss each idea openly and not shut down any possibilities until we refine our list. Each person can share their thoughts on each idea shared to encourage active listening and participation among our group.,I encourage others on the team to contribute,I ask my teammates for feedback on how I can improve,"I help my team adhere to schedules, e.g., engaging in timeline checks, adjusting schedules as needed",,0

Additionally, how will you measure whether you successfully learn about manufacturing with good tolerances or improve from your mistakes?","Verbally discuss ideas, Document ideas in a document, Shared workspace for adding in important group work (google drive folder), Use groupchat for quick and simple messages, Meet as a team for more complex discussions/ idea iteration/ communication, Groupchat to set meetings or talk briefly about project, Use when2meet to find times to meet that work for everyone, Zoom meetings

","It sounds like you have a solid plan for your team's communication! Could you describe a bit more about how you'll manage your response times in the group chat and other communication methods? Additionally, how do you envision documenting decisions or ideas during your meetings?","During our weekly meeting time, we will make sure that wee catch up on any pending messages from the groupchat and we will keep meeting minutes, each week a different person is responsible for this.","For project ideas, and deciding which to pick/ what software to use we will use a majority vote or pairwise comparison chart. If a team member cannot attend meeting, they forfeit the right to make decisions but will be briefed on the meeting after and given details on how decisions were made. They can disagree within 10 hours of meeting and explain why, the team can then revert/change opinion, or decide to continue with the plan decided during meeting. Decisions will be documented in shared google drive and post-meeting minutes/updates will be posted in group chat. ","I appreciate your detailed response! Could you describe a bit more about how you will facilitate the discussion during meetings to ensure everyone's voice is heard before making decisions? Additionally, how will you ensure that the team members who may be missing feel included in the decision-making process when they catch up later?","We will be sure that the meeting minutes are shared with them, and any critical decisions are followed up on with the missing team member before going ahead with it. We will hold each other accountable for speaking. If someone has not spoken, team members should prompt them and ask if they have any opinions.","-	Regular meeting time: Mondays at 8pm (virtually)
-	We will rotate roles every week based on what needs to happen and assigned tasks from previous week

","I appreciate your response! Could you describe a bit more about how you will decide which roles need to be filled each week? Additionally, how will you ensure everyone is comfortable with their assigned roles, especially if someone might prefer a specific position?","We will randomly assign roles using a random number generator (roles are numbered 1 to 6) and if someone is particularly uncomfortable with their role, they can voice their concern and we can swap it with someone who is happy to take it on. If someone is adamant about having a specific position, we can ask team members if it's ok for them to have that position through every meeting. ","- Every week discussing upcoming tasks/ what is expected, dividing work, and assigning it to each individual
- Set team roles to use everyones strengths (see below)
- We need a communication coordinator who will set times to meet and create meeting links (if online)
- We need someone responsible for submitting team work (if only one person per group needs to submit it)
- Technical lead (responsible for assigning technical tasks)
- Document lead
- Design Lead (make documents/presentations more visually appealling/clearer communication)

","Could you describe a bit more about how you plan to support team members in developing new skills? Also, how will you ensure that the work gets completed on time and meets a high standard of quality? It sounds like you have defined specific roles, but I’m curious about your plans for communication and teamwork dynamics.","People with particular skills can be paired up with someone who wants to learn that skill and they can be a peer mentor, and those two people are responsible for that design element for that week. If moe than one person is comfortable doing a specific part of the work, we can also ensure they work together so we can have different perspectives on what is being done. Individual assignments should be kept to a minimum
","- Establish an open channel for communication (if anyone faces any adversities they can talk to the team and work things out together, no need to wait until the last minute or panic, just talk to the rest of us)
- Deliberately assigning tasks (clear what is expected of everyone)
- Open room for disagreements during idea iteration (please do this constructively)
- At the end of each meeting before hanging up, ask if everyone is happy with how the meeting went/ if not, why and how can we improve next time

","I appreciate your response; you have some solid ideas in place! Could you describe a bit more about how you plan to facilitate those open channels for communication? For example, what specific strategies might you implement to ensure team members feel comfortable bringing up their concerns or ideas? Also, how might you encourage constructive disagreements to foster a safe space for everyone to share their thoughts?",We will have check ins at the end of meetings and ensure everyone feels free to message the team leader if they would like to voice a concern . We will also make an anonymous form if anyone wants to bring up a concern but does not feel comfortable doing so in a group environment.,I help teammates who are falling behind,I encourage others on the team to contribute,"I help my team adhere to schedules, e.g., engaging in timeline checks, adjusting schedules as needed",,0
