Breaking down complex concepts more clearly could help align the team and improve collaboration.,One improvement could be focusing on the bigger picture and prioritizing tasks accordingly. This could help prevent getting too caught up in small details and allow for more strategic thinking.,One area for growth could be actively seeking input from others before making decisions. Involving the team more in decision-making could foster collaboration and ensure everyone feels valued in the process.,,2
