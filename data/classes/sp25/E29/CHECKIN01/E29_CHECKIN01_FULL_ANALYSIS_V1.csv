In addition to refining our 2D and 3D modeling skills, we aim to ensure that every team member's ideas are thoroughly considered and discussed before making decisions. By maintaining regular updates through our group chat and actively collaborating, we will create accurate, detailed CAD models that effectively showcase our project and allow others to learn from our work. Our focus is not just on technical accuracy but also on fostering an inclusive and well-organized creative process.","So far our goals have remained relatively the same, maintaining good communication and documentation of our processes and ideas.",We have continued to communicate! Our group chat is used daily to even discuss things outside of the classroom which is great bonding and our chemistry together is killer!
