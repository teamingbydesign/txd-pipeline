Mario: I personally find that communication via text on apps that can be used on both a phone and a computer work best for me as I am more likely to respond quickly. This is mainly discord.

Danny: Contacting me through my phone is the quickest way to reach me. Either through an app like slack or a text message. I might not be on my computer but I will likely have my phone on me so I can reply in a reasonable time and/or collaborate from my device if needed. 

Jasmine: I prefer text or instagram communication as it’s most likely to catch my attention and easiest to respond to compared to email or slack. If we are planning or designing, I prefer in person or voice communication of some kind. 

Jae Won: Text or any other messaging platform is the quickest way to reach me. I struggle with solving technical problems over text and usually require a discord call to walk through problems, so text is best for telling me to jump onto a call. Google drive is ok for file management, but a PDM like Fusion or OnShape is better for CAD files. We already do group chats through text, which works well for coordination, but may want a server with designated channels in the future for discussing specific topics. 

Jackson: Texting me or calling me is the quickest way of communicating with me. I would also prefer to use OnShape for any CAD done in the class since we can easily share it with everyone and everyone will have access to it.
