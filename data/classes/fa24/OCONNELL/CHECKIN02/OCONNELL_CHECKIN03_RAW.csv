Everyone was always clear about what work needed to be done. By the end of the semester, everyone was comfortable sharing their ideas and voicing their opinions on our plan. Cultivating a sense of trust in a team is important for success and this is something I will bring to my next team. ","Sometimes, people were not great about communicating when they were stuck or needed help on a task. It felt as though sometimes only part of the team was working while the other team members had no tasks to work on. In a future team, I plan to divide work evenly and ensure everyone feels that they have sufficient tasks and is participating in every aspect of the project. ","Every time we needed to submit a deliverable for class, we would discuss as a group during our weekly meeting who would be working on which parts of the submission and everyone was always involved in the decision making of every phase of the design. Our weekly meetings were always used for status updates and making important decisions and outline next steps for our design. Having a weekly meeting where we could all meet and discuss was crucial in our success and ensuring everyone was meeting deadlines and completing tasks. ","I think the most important thing is making sure people do not feel like they have to work on a task entirely on their own, especially when an issue arises or other commitments get in the way. A big aspect of this is trust because if a team trusts each other, then they can trust others to get the work done or at least help to alleviate some of the workload. Possibly having more frequent check-ins offline whether it's over text or email just to make sure tasks are meeting our deadlines and timelines. I think these changes would have positive effects on a team's effectiveness because then several teammates can speak to certain aspects of the project rather than just one and we can accomplish more if we share the load.",Ensures we are always meeting deliverables' expectations and keeps us goal oriented when decision making.,Always willing to step up and help with additional tasks to ensure we met deadlines and presented a successful project.,Goal oriented and ensured that meetings were efficient and deliverable and design were meeting deadlines and timeline.,Always willing to put in extra work to help produce a technically sound and meaningful design.,Always willing to offer feedback and help with additional tasks ,Went above and beyond to help our project reach success and has incredible attention to detail for design and manufacturing.,Guiding meetings and leading the group could help keep the team more goal oriented and inspire them to new ideas.,Sharing your ideas and reservations with the group more often could help the team be more efficient and lead to great new ideas.,Delegating tasks and allowing others the opportunity to lead group meetings.

I think often work fell on specific members of the group.,"We used a group chat for communication amongst group members. People were very responsible in terms of asking questions, answering questions, filling out when2meets for meetings, etc. I thought this made a difference in the success of our group as there was not much time when our group was in limbo. There was always something being done allowing for our group to be on task. Effective communication played a major role when Joe needed help on the circuitry design so over thanksgiving break he asked us to research if circuits other than a DC would be better for our design ","I think our issue with distributing roles evenly came from not understanding what everyone's strong points were. Especially being partnered with a bunch of mechanical engineers they all have very similar skills but did not want to take charge of certain areas. Being a bioengineering major, I took the role of using my knowledge about biomechanics to integrate a design that worked well with postural kyphosis. It was also hard to distribute roles with the hardware because the hardware couldn't be split up, so therefore Joe was often the one working directly with the electronics. I think this made it hard because people wanted to help out but didn't know how to. Uneven distribution was definitely not intentional it was just hard with the components of our project.

Additionally, assigning a rotating facilitator could help ensure everyone stays on track and feels involved.

This approach would improve overall team effectiveness by promoting accountability, identifying potential issues early, and fostering better collaboration. Frequent updates would ensure that everyone is aligned with the shared goals and timelines, reducing last-minute stress and enabling smoother progress toward project milestones.

While this worked in keeping up with the check-in assignments set by the professor, it didn't leave us with too much time to rapidly iterate through the print, test, and improvement phase of our project. Going forward, having a tentative project timeline that we set at the start of the semester will help us better prepare and make adjustments as we go along. ","Our meetings were always about 50 minutes long and we never really had the need to go beyond that time as each meeting lead came in with a set agenda that helped keep our meeting on track. Every meeting followed an effective template that started with everyone checking in how each other's week had gone during Berkeley time. Once we started our meeting at Berkeley time, we would always take about 10 minutes to share each individuals progress on previously delegated tasks to determine what needs to be done. From there, we would discuss the next deliverable, the expectations of the upcoming deliverable, what decisions need to be made during the meeting, what tasks need to be done by when, and who is in charge of each task. This discussion would never take more than 20-30 minutes. From there, our last 10 minutes would consist of clarifying questions and ensuring that everyone is on the same page. 

Detailed notes regarding the content of the meeting were taken on google docs by that week's notetaker. At the end of each meeting, the team lead/notetaker would send a TLDR on our messages group chat which helped clear any lingering confusion regarding task delegation. This truly helped us ensure that everyone is on the same page and that we are able to make decisions rapidly, enabling efficient progress.","I had this realization when we had our meeting (Monday of thanksgiving break) to get our Lofi prototype deliverable ready the week before it was due. Our Monday meeting went efficiently as usual and we were able to get out lofi prototype submission done comfortably. However, we weren't aware of the changing and unpredictable turnaround times for 3D printing at our local 3D printing centers. Some of the prints could take up to as long as 4-5 days, leaving us with a matter of few days to test our prototype and probably not enough time to 3D print an improved version. 

With this uncertainty, we were pretty panicked about finding alternative places to 3D print (such as asking family/friends, people on reddit, and exploring my high school's 3D printing facilities). The Jacobs 3D printing facility ended up working out since we had caught it on a low-traffic day the first time, however, our second print took about 3-4 days.

Being introduced and welcomed to work with them made me feel very comfortable at times and I believe that it made it easier to share feedback and opinions. However, at times I also felt isolated because I feel as though I was more just helping their project instead of being a part of it.","It was understood by the members that the down period of communication was temporary due to other class commitments and external factors. However, now looking back, I did feel as though I had a somewhat unfair burden with regards to being the primary person working on the code and technical deliverables for both labs. In both cases, I completed drafts of the code and figures well before the deadlines and requested my group to check and provide feedback. However, I would get no response for days and the team would have to scramble to finish assignments during our short team meetings instead of working on the project. 

It became apparent that the report was started last minute, and we had to help complete and facilitate that process beyond what was agreed upon in terms of work division. In the end we still had to submit the report late. Furthermore, we had a lot of communication issues throughout the last weeks of the semester. I tried to communicate with the group to find times to meet to create the prototype and plan out our next deliverables, but on multiple occasions I was either left on read for days or meeting times were not respected (30min - 1hr delays) where certain members had to leave early to go to work commitments.

I think to improve accountability would require me to bring these concerns up earlier in the semester to set a group standard. The main reason that I did not is that up until now I did not realize or come to think regarding my share of the work compared to the other group. Potentially involving the instructor earlier on and asking group members to hold better accountability and responsibility towards the times we booked for us to work on this project. If we had better communication and more time, I am confident that we would have been able to create a more cohesive and comprehensive prototype and accompanying report.","CAD, 3D printing, visual aid creation, project and deliverable initiation, poor sense of human and self-deprication","Sewing expertise, eagerness to work and communciate with group",Circuit and electronics expertise.

Also, definitely create a timeline for better time management. Also, make it clear that who ever is doing the assignment it has to be reviewed by all party members before submission.","Our team worked on the prototype in a collaborative setting that emphasized brainstorming, rapid iteration, and testing. We began by identifying the needs of our target users--individuals with shaky hands who could benefit from an assistive writing device. From initial concept sketches to our first physical prototype, we focused on aligning goals and addressing core functionalities.

The design process involved several key steps. Through brainstorming and research, we identified essential features such as comfort and stability, with each team member contributing unique ideas. After building the initial prototype, we tested it and observed issues like grip instability and weight distribution. Feedback from mock users and advisors guided refinements, such as redistributing weight and improving pen support. Each iteration included redesigning in CAD, reprinting, and retesting, with team members alternating responsibilities to ensure diverse perspectives. Detailed documentation kept us organized throughout.

The iterative process significantly boosted our success. It enhanced collaboration by leveraging each member's strengths and improved communication through shared decision-making. Repeated testing ensured a user-centered design that effectively addressed key needs. Finally, working through challenges together strengthened team dynamics and trust. This process not only resulted in a functional prototype but also highlighted the power of teamwork and adaptability.","Assigning specific roles can help a team work more efficiently by providing clarity and structure. When each member knows their responsibilities, it minimizes confusion, reduces overlap in tasks, and ensures that critical areas are covered. For instance, one member might focus on research, another on data analysis, and a third on documentation. This specialization allows each person to work on tasks aligned with their strengths, speeding up progress and enhancing the quality of work. Additionally, clear roles foster accountability, as everyone understands what they are expected to contribute and can take ownership of their tasks.

Addressing issues sooner, while essential, can be challenging. One difficulty is that team members may hesitate to raise concerns, fearing conflict or disrupting group harmony. There's also the possibility of miscommunication or differing perspectives, which can delay resolution. To overcome these challenges, the team would need to create a culture of open communication where constructive feedback is welcomed, and issues are framed as opportunities for improvement rather than criticism. Encouraging regular check-ins and fostering trust can also make it easier to tackle problems early.

Clearer timelines and regular reviews would have a significant positive impact on team performance. Timelines help the team stay organized and focused, breaking the project into manageable steps and ensuring steady progress. By knowing deadlines for each phase, team members can plan their work more effectively and avoid last-minute stress. Meanwhile, reviewing assignments before submission ensures the quality of work is high and aligns with team goals. It also provides an opportunity for collaboration, as members can offer suggestions and catch potential errors. Together, these strategies create a more efficient and cohesive workflow, ultimately leading to stronger outcomes and a more unified team.","Olivia took the lead on organizing, making the video, and writing the report to help ensure we stayed on track by creating clear action plans, guiding discussions, and maintaining focus on our shared goals.",Evan brought technical expertise and a strong drive for excellence.,"Sebastien contributed diligently by completing tasks as assigned and adding a uniques perspective to our discussions, despite some challenged with language difference.",David provided the material needed to prototype and helped with brainstorming new techniques for each prototype iteration.,"Eileen acted as a supportive and empathetic teammate, fostering collaboration and ensuring everyone felt hear, which strengthened our team dynamics and decision-making process.

One concrete thing that our team did well that I would bring to the next time I joined was discuss our skill sets and what we wanted to individually contribute at the beginning of the semester and keep that in mind throughout the process. I think that made it much easier to divide up tasks and kept our group running smoothly.","One concrete thing I think we should do differently on the next team you join is be stricter with meeting schedule times. At the beginning of the year, we planned to meet much more often than we actually did and our group rarely met all together. However, we all shared our schedules and they really just did not match up well, but we managed to all contribute and meet throughout the semester regardless.","At the beginning of the semester, we made a list of values that we would hold ourselves accountable for. We all decided that we wanted create a space where everyone could feel like they were comfortable sharing and respected each other's opinion. Since we all developed these values together, they were values that we all wanted and felt were important which is why I feel like they were maintained throughout the semester. Communication between members also improved as the semester went on since we got to know each other better. Some specific ways we maintained good progress throughout the semester was mainly due to the different earlier deadlines. Additionally, since at least a few group members tried meeting after class most of the time, we always were slowly progressing since we would discuss any assignments and tasks together and knew what needed to be done. The positive effect that this success can have on a team going forward is that we all feel comfortable with each other and respect one another. After working on a team where there is a good environment that stays on task and makes good progress, each one of us can bring those skills to benefit future teams moving forward.","I think having stricter meeting times would cause more people to attend all the meetings or put in a greater effort to try to find meeting times that work for everyone. This was difficult for our group but could have maybe worked if we met late at night which would not be possible to do in person. If we were able to all meet together more, we would all be able to contribute during discussions which would provide more perspectives which is great in the field of design. We would not have had to catch each other up as much or send as many messages through What's App. We would have been more effective since we would not have to go back and forth as much. Specific changes that I think would help ensure everyone can meet more consistently is maybe make a meeting schedule farther into the semester since people's schedules change from the beginning of the semester. Also, identifying this at the beginning of the semester and discussing the importance of everyone coming to meeting would have helped.","Good at leading discussions, taking initiative when we have assignments, and presenting material.",Brought unique insights and ideas for solving problems with our prototype.,Great at making the circuits and sewing.
