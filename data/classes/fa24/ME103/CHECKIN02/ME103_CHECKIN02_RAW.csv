This would ensure that responsibilities are balanced and aligned with each team member's strengths and availability, avoiding uneven workloads.","Our team set clear deadlines during our initial planning phase, ensuring each milestone aligned with the projectâ€™s overarching timeline. Weekly check-ins allowed us to revisit these deadlines, adapt to unforeseen challenges, and remain on track. As the scribe/project leader during meetings, my role was to document key discussions, decisions, and action items, which helped ensure accountability and clarity for everyone involved.

This consistent communication ensured trust and cohesion within the team, reducing misunderstandings and ensuring that everyone had a clear understanding of their tasks. It also allowed us to identify and address issues promptly, which greatly improved our efficiency and overall performance.","During the project, there were moments when the work distribution felt uneven, particularly during the data collection phase and while working on milestone assignments and the final draft of the paper. I often found myself doing more work than needed, and so did some other members, which was time-consuming and required significant attention to detail. Additionally, some milestone assignments and parts of the final draft could have benefited from more collaborative input, as certain team members didn't contribute as much as expected. 

To promote clearer work allocation in the future, I would suggest setting more explicit expectations about who is responsible for which tasks from the beginning, with regular check-ins to assess progress. Additionally, I would encourage more proactive engagement from all team members, particularly during crucial stages like data collection and writing, ensuring that workloads are shared more evenly. This approach would likely improve the overall effectiveness of the team by preventing bottlenecks and ensuring that everyone is equally invested in the projectâ€™s success.","Project-lead, recorded data/weekly meetings, made sure the group knew the deadlines","Co-project-lead, helped in spearing the project, helped with all milestones and draft. did more work than need","cool guy, helped alot in the data collection phase and would reach out to departments to ask to use equipment ","helped in reaching out to use equipment, helped with data collection, wish they communicated more","helped in reaching out to use equipment, helped with data collection, wish they communicated more","helped in reaching out to use equipment, helped with data collection, wish they communicated more",give more work to others,give more work to others,speak up more,do more work and communicate more effectively,do more work and communicate more effectively,do more work and communicate more effectively,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"It sounds like your team was really effective in maintaining communication through weekly check-ins and deadlines.

One specific thing we did well was regularly providing updates during meetings, which kept everyone aligned and allowed us to address challenges collaboratively. I would bring this practice of consistent communication and progress tracking to the next team I join.","One thing I would do differently on the next team I join is to bring up any issues or concerns about team dynamics or individual challenges earlier in the process. Addressing these matters proactively can help prevent misunderstandings and ensure smoother collaboration throughout the project.
","The regular updates took place during our weekly team meetings, where each member shared their progress on assigned tasks and flagged any issues they encountered. For example, one challenge we faced was a delay in collecting certain data due to equipment availability. By discussing it early, we were able to reallocate tasks and adjust our timeline to stay on track.

The positive outcomes of this consistent communication included improved alignment within the team, faster problem-solving, and a greater sense of accountability. It ensured that everyone was aware of the projectâ€™s status and allowed us to adapt quickly to any changes or obstacles.","In one situation, two team members had their tasks mixed up, but no one brought it up until much closer to the deadline. This mix-up led to confusion about who was responsible for what and caused delays in completing those tasks, requiring the team to rush to make adjustments and finish on time.

To prevent this in the future, I would propose implementing a task review system early in the process, where the team double-checks and confirms their responsibilities at the start of the project and during regular updates. I would also encourage an open forum during meetings where members can clarify roles and ask questions if anything seems unclear.

By addressing such issues earlier, the team would benefit from better organization, reduced stress, and a stronger ability to deliver quality results on time.","Ernesto consistently brought strong analytical skills to the team, ensuring that our data was accurate and meaningful, while also fostering a collaborative atmosphere with his encouraging attitude.","Antonio was instrumental in keeping the team organized, frequently summarizing action items and helping us stay on track with deadlines through clear communication and planning.","Adrianâ€™s creative problem-solving approach helped the team tackle unexpected challenges effectively, and he also kept the team morale high with his positive and optimistic mindset.","I contributed by being proactive in discussions, ensuring everyoneâ€™s ideas were heard, and taking on hands-on tasks to support the teamâ€™s progress while fostering open communication.",,,"I suggest Ernesto could take on a more vocal leadership role during meetings to guide discussions, as his analytical skills would greatly benefit the teamâ€™s direction.

He could implement this by asking for input on task preferences and assigning roles collaboratively.",Adrian might benefit from focusing more on time management to ensure his creative solutions align with project deadlines.

My team and I were always available. Whether we were in person or not, if anyone had a question or needed help regarding the project, the rest of us were just a message away. Usually, a team member would get a response within seconds.","Although our communication was very good, the way that we divided up work was not the greatest. There was never a clear, concrete method of deciding who was doing what parts when it came to an assignment. For example, in almost all of the milestones, we would talk about when it is due and what we had to do to complete it and then we would just start working. People would start in different places and eventually we would all meet in the middle and finish it up. Because of this, some people end up doing more than others and, overall, the way work is divided could be much more effective and it will definitely be something I think about in future teams.","One specific situation where communication and being accessible helped us all was when we didn't really have an idea as to where our project was heading in the beginning. Our group had not set a date and time to discuss this topic and we had gone a few days without speaking. Out of the blue, David messaged our group chat and mentioned that we should probably start thinking about the next steps moving forward. The rest of the team, including me, immediately replied and we even started talking about it right then and there. The ability to be so accessible allowed our team to solve issues as soon as possible, even immediately sometimes. To make sure that our team felt supported, I would always ask others if they needed help or I would always be willing to help if somebody else asked me for it. Even if it wasn't necessarily something that was my part, I would still try my best to be useful. Effective communication definitely played a part in my team's success because it allowed us to be more at ease knowing that our teammates were just a message away, no matter the date or time. This gave us a sense of comfort working with each other because we knew that we were always there to support and help each other.","One specific milestone where this applied was milestone D, the rough draft of our final report. We needed an extension because one of our teammates, Connor, had some other things going on and he couldn't really help us during the week it was due. Because of this, David and I started to work without him and try to get as much done as we could. Since we did that, we ended up doing more than Connor in the end. Next time, I will be sure to assign or ask my teammates to assign themselves sections of the reports so that we know which parts to do and which parts not to touch and leave to the others. Implementing these changes would be a good impact because then everyone would know what they are doing and how much of it they are doing. That way everyone is able to do equal amounts of work in the end.","great at pcb design, technically gifted, wrote one section of the report","committed lots of hours, stayed up late, collected data, wrote parts of the report","was the General (always messaged first), collected data, created graphs, wrote parts of the report",,,,"talk to the team more and be more involved in data collection, planning, etc.","don't be afraid to talk first, be more open and social, share more ideas","share more ideas, don't be afraid to ask questions",,,,3,3,2,,,,2,1,1,,,,3,2,2,,,,1,1,1,,,,2,"It sounds like communication was a strong point for your team, and it's great that everyone was so accessible!

For example, we had an ""experimentation"" channel to talk about all things that the name implies. Using Discord made it easier to stay organized, keep all project materials in one place, and avoid the distractions of other apps like texting.

But we should have thought more about the timeline of our experiment and if the goals we set for them can be practically achieved or not. ","We were very ambitious with our goals from the start of the semester. Instead of sticking to only one method we decided to go with two methods: tensile testing and 3 point bending. Because of this our testing time doubled, as the number of test runs that we did was equal for both method, coming in at 60 trials for each one. 
This allowed us to see the differences between the two methods and see if any correlation existed between the two types. Obviously a lot of quality work was done here, which allowed us to have a good analysis within our experiment. ","We were very ambitious with our goals from the start of the semester.
