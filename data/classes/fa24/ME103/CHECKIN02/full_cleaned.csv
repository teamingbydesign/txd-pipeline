I would regularly check in with them to ensure they are completing their tasks and to address any potential misunderstandings about their roles. For instance, one member, Angel, communicated very little with us, particularly regarding the final report and during in-person meetings. In the future, I would prioritize more frequent check-ins to ensure roles are clearly defined and everyone stays on track.","Our team used Discord to create a clear and focused space for project communication. The project required us to share updates, work on tasks together, and manage things like the final report, data, and references in relation to our project. To keep communication consistent and open, we set up specific channels for different topics and had regular check-ins. For example, we had an ""experimentation"" channel to talk about all things that the name implies. Using Discord made it easier to stay organized, keep all project materials in one place, and avoid the distractions of other apps like texting. This approach helped our team work better together, reduced confusion, and kept everyone motivated to finish tasks on time","To initiate check-ins, I would start by reaching out through a friendly message or scheduling a quick meeting to ask how things are going with their tasks. Iâ€™d keep the tone casual and supportive to make it easy for them to respond. To make teammates feel comfortable sharing, Iâ€™d focus on being approachable, listening without judgment, and showing that Iâ€™m there to help. I think that, even sharing my own challenges, make people feel like their not alone either.

For this project, we had team meetings weekly at first, but towards the end of the semester we began to have them biweekly or on different days/times.

Instead, it would have been helpful for one of us to have created a google calendar invite with a date, time, and place for our meeting. This would ensure we were all aware of the meeting. ","This form of organization was very effective for our team because we all had different roles at different points of our project, therefore ensuring everyone was able to access any changes or updates made was essential. For instance, at the beginning I designed and laser cut our soundproof box. By adding the design files into our shared folder, I ensured that everyone had access to the final design, dimensions, etc which was later helpful to our teammates who were writing our final report. This made our project development smoother because it avoided confusion. ","A formal scheduling method would impact a team meetings effectiveness because it would ensure clarity - everyone knows where and when the meeting is happening - whereas a simple text in a groupchat might not be seen by everyone, it would effectively remind the teammates of the meeting,  given that calendar invites usually have an alert minutes before the meeting, and it would formally establish the event.

Addressing these matters proactively can help prevent misunderstandings and ensure smoother collaboration throughout the project.
","The regular updates took place during our weekly team meetings, where each member shared their progress on assigned tasks and flagged any issues they encountered. For example, one challenge we faced was a delay in collecting certain data due to equipment availability. By discussing it early, we were able to reallocate tasks and adjust our timeline to stay on track.

The positive outcomes of this consistent communication included improved alignment within the team, faster problem-solving, and a greater sense of accountability. It ensured that everyone was aware of the projectâ€™s status and allowed us to adapt quickly to any changes or obstacles.","In one situation, two team members had their tasks mixed up, but no one brought it up until much closer to the deadline. This mix-up led to confusion about who was responsible for what and caused delays in completing those tasks, requiring the team to rush to make adjustments and finish on time.

To prevent this in the future, I would propose implementing a task review system early in the process, where the team double-checks and confirms their responsibilities at the start of the project and during regular updates. I would also encourage an open forum during meetings where members can clarify roles and ask questions if anything seems unclear.

By addressing such issues earlier, the team would benefit from better organization, reduced stress, and a stronger ability to deliver quality results on time.","Ernesto consistently brought strong analytical skills to the team, ensuring that our data was accurate and meaningful, while also fostering a collaborative atmosphere with his encouraging attitude.","Antonio was instrumental in keeping the team organized, frequently summarizing action items and helping us stay on track with deadlines through clear communication and planning.","Adrianâ€™s creative problem-solving approach helped the team tackle unexpected challenges effectively, and he also kept the team morale high with his positive and optimistic mindset.","I contributed by being proactive in discussions, ensuring everyoneâ€™s ideas were heard, and taking on hands-on tasks to support the teamâ€™s progress while fostering open communication.",No Response,No Response,"I suggest Ernesto could take on a more vocal leadership role during meetings to guide discussions, as his analytical skills would greatly benefit the teamâ€™s direction.

Another goal we met was to meet periodically to discuss data collection, report work, and what we were going to do next.",One individual goal that I had that I met was to not leave my team stranded. I made sure to contribute a significant amount of my time and effort to the project so that my team felt that the project was moving along at a good pace and so they knew that they could rely on me as a teammate.,6.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,23,40,37,0,0,0,"One thing that we did extremely well that I would take to my next team is the level of communication. My team and I were always available. Whether we were in person or not, if anyone had a question or needed help regarding the project, the rest of us were just a message away. Usually, a team member would get a response within seconds.","Although our communication was very good, the way that we divided up work was not the greatest. There was never a clear, concrete method of deciding who was doing what parts when it came to an assignment. For example, in almost all of the milestones, we would talk about when it is due and what we had to do to complete it and then we would just start working. People would start in different places and eventually we would all meet in the middle and finish it up. Because of this, some people end up doing more than others and, overall, the way work is divided could be much more effective and it will definitely be something I think about in future teams.","One specific situation where communication and being accessible helped us all was when we didn't really have an idea as to where our project was heading in the beginning. Our group had not set a date and time to discuss this topic and we had gone a few days without speaking. Out of the blue, David messaged our group chat and mentioned that we should probably start thinking about the next steps moving forward. The rest of the team, including me, immediately replied and we even started talking about it right then and there. The ability to be so accessible allowed our team to solve issues as soon as possible, even immediately sometimes. To make sure that our team felt supported, I would always ask others if they needed help or I would always be willing to help if somebody else asked me for it. Even if it wasn't necessarily something that was my part, I would still try my best to be useful. Effective communication definitely played a part in my team's success because it allowed us to be more at ease knowing that our teammates were just a message away, no matter the date or time. This gave us a sense of comfort working with each other because we knew that we were always there to support and help each other.","One specific milestone where this applied was milestone D, the rough draft of our final report. We needed an extension because one of our teammates, Connor, had some other things going on and he couldn't really help us during the week it was due. Because of this, David and I started to work without him and try to get as much done as we could. Since we did that, we ended up doing more than Connor in the end. Next time, I will be sure to assign or ask my teammates to assign themselves sections of the reports so that we know which parts to do and which parts not to touch and leave to the others. Implementing these changes would be a good impact because then everyone would know what they are doing and how much of it they are doing. That way everyone is able to do equal amounts of work in the end.","great at pcb design, technically gifted, wrote one section of the report","committed lots of hours, stayed up late, collected data, wrote parts of the report","was the General (always messaged first), collected data, created graphs, wrote parts of the report",No Response,No Response,No Response,"talk to the team more and be more involved in data collection, planning, etc.","don't be afraid to talk first, be more open and social, share more ideas","share more ideas, don't be afraid to ask questions",No Response,No Response,No Response,5.0,5.0,6.0,No Response,No Response,No Response,6.0,7.0,7.0,No Response,No Response,No Response,5.0,6.0,6.0,No Response,No Response,No Response,7.0,7.0,7.0,No Response,No Response,No Response,2
