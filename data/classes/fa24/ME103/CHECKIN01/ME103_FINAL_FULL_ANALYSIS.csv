From there we can attempt to process the data into usable information to calculate our desired coefficient. ,Our goal is to utilize the wind tunnel and existing instrumentation to characterize the porous medium of a car's radiator by measuring pressure differences as air flows through the radiator. ,"Our team's goals have evolved considerably since the beginning of the project. Our team's goal now is to use the wind tunnel as much as possible to get data, with independent variables being radiator angle, from which we can draw conclusions about the impact of the radiator angle on wind speed. We will also be drawing measurements for varying Z-heights of the pitot go see if this has a large impact on our measurements.",No Response,,5.6,6.1,0.9,,5.6,5.8,1.1,,6.0,6.2,0.8,,6.0,6.3,0.8,,5.6,6.1,1.0,,5.6,6.0,1.1,,6.2,6.4,0.8,No Response,No Response,No Response,No Response,No Response,No Response,No Response,7.8,16.7,46.7,,3.0,No Response,"We got our hardware designed, checked off and fabricated on time.",We communicated online and made decisions together as outlined,Collaboration and communication.,One thing our team is doing well is communicating progress and coordinating meeting times.,"My team is doing well maintaining solid communication in our discord group chat.

While we are organized and all understand our roles, we oftentimes wait too long to think about things and end up being unable to do as much as we wanted (for example, we didn't realize we had to sign up for wind tunnel testing times over a week in advance to get a time slot.",No Response,No Response,He has a high chance to drop this class,No Response,Fabrication,Mount design,he is going to drop the class so he has not shown up,No Response,No Response,No Response,No Response,Presence. ,No Response,he is not here,No Response,No Response,4.8,6.1,1.1,No Response,5.0,6.2,1.0,No Response,5.0,6.2,1.1,No Response,5.2,6.4,0.8,No Response,-2.8,-0.3000000000000007,-0.20000000000000018,-0.5,-0.20000000000000018,-0.20000000000000018,-0.2999999999999998,-0.5,-0.40000000000000036,-0.20000000000000018,21.74,Standard,190,108 - Examination of cold-flow aerodynamic resistance of a Formula SAE car radiator
